### Problem 1: Express 19.07 as a mixed number

Thinking Process:

1. Split it into whole and decimal parts - 19.07 = 19 + 0.07.

2. Decimals can be written as fractions, digits / power of 10.

3. 0.07 = 7/100, since 7 is in the hundreds place.

4. Then, combine whole and fraction to - 19 7/100.

### Problem 2: Express 0.6239 as a fraction

1. Each digit after the decimal point corresponds to a power of 10 in the denominator.

2. 0.6239 has 4 digits after the decimals - so the denominator is 10,000.

3. 0.6239 = 6239/10,000.

### Problem 3: Express 9.58 as a mixed number

1. A mixed number combines a whole number and a proper fraction.
   Each digit after the decimal point corresponds to a denominator that is a power of 10.

2. The decimal number 9.58 has a whole number part - 9, and a fractional part - 0.58.
   The fractional part end in the hundreds place, 2 digits after the decimal.

3. I separated the whole number and decimal to:
   9.58 = 9 + 0.58.
   Then, converted the decimal to fraction:
   0.58 = 58/100.
   So it turns 9.58 = 9 58/100.

### Problem 4: Express 0.0939 as a fraction

1. Each digit after the decimal pont represents a fraction power of 10. If a number has n digits after the decimal point, the denominator will be 10n.

2. The number 0.0939 has 4 digits after the decimal point, so the denominator will be 4 times of ten equal 10,000. The numerator is simply the digits without the decimal - 939.

3. 0.0939 = 939/10,000.

4. I checked the GCD of 939 and 10,000 = 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

### Problem 5: Express 16.54 as a mixed number

1. A mixed number is a whole number plus a proper fraction, and a decimal can be written as fraction by looking at the place values of its digits.

2. The given number is 16.54, the whole num part is 16, and the decimal part is 0.54, which ends in the hundreds place - denominator = 100.

3. So I wrote the decimal part as a fraction which is:
   0.54 = 54/100, then combined it with the whole num part: 16.54 = 16 54/100.

### Problem 6: Express 0.1019 as a fraction

1. A decimal with **_n_** digits after the point can be expressed as a fraction with denominator **_10n_**.
2. The num 0.1019 has 4 digits after the decimal means its denominator is 10 in the power of 4 = 10,000.
3. I wrote the num without the decimal as numerator: 1019.
   Then, I placed it over the denominator: 0.1019 = 1019/10,000.

### Problem 7: Express 8.21 as a mixed number

1. A mixed num consists of a whole num and a fraction.

2. The num 8.21 has 2 digits after the decimal which is in the hundredths place. So I separated the num from the decimal part: 8.21 = 8 + 0.21.

3. Then, I converted it to a fraction: 0.21 = 21/100, and combined it to a whole num with the fraction to get a mixed num: 8.21 = 8 21/100.

### Problem 8: Rewrite the fraction 94/5 as a decimal

1. A fraction **_a/b_** could be written as a decimal by dividing the numerator **_a_** by the denominator **_b_**.
2. The numerator is 94 and the denominator is 5, so I'm looking for how many times 5 goes into 94.
3. I divided 94÷5, and found that 5 goes 18 times into 94 because 18 x 5 = 94 with a remainder of 4. Then I converted 4/5 to a decimal - 0.8.
4. Lastly, I combined the whole num and decimal to:
   18 + 0.8 = 18.8, and checked that 18.8 multiplies by 5 is 94.
