### Problem 1: Order the following **numbers** from **least to greatest**. Put the least value on the left.

- -14 1/5
- -14.4
- -14.04

I started by noticing that all the numbers are **negative**, so the more negative a number is, the **smaller** it is.

- First, I compared the number **_-14.4_** with the others. Since it's the farthest left on the number line meaning more negative, it's the **least**.
- Then, I looked at **_-14 1/5_**, which is the same as **_-14.2_** in decimal form. That's larger than -14.4 but still smaller than -14.04.
- Finally, **_-14.04_** is the closest to **zero**, so it's the **greatest** among the three.

So the answer is - from least to greatest: **-14.4, -14 1/5, -14.04**.

### Problem 2: Which of the following numbers are less than 9/4?

Choose all answers that apply:

**A.** 11/4
**B.** 15/8
**C.** 2.201

To figure out which numbers are less than 9/4, I first converted 9/4 into a decimal because it's easier to compare numbers in the same format.

- To convert a fraction to a decimal, I **divide the numerator by the denominator**.

9/4 = 9 ÷ 4 = 2.25

Now, I compare each number to 2.25:

- **A. 11/4** → 11 ÷ 4 = 2.75, which is bigger than 2.25, so it's **_not less than 9/4_**.
- **B. 15/8** → 15 ÷ 8 = 1.875, which is **_less_** than 2.25, so this **_works_**.
- **C. 2.201** → 2.201 is already in decimal form and is smaller than 2.25, so this **_works as well_**.

So, the numbers that are less than 9/4 are: **15/8 and 2.201**

### Problem 3: Order the following numbers from least to greatest.

**_Put the least value on the left._**

- 0.92
- 0.85
- 8/9

Since there are two decimals and one fraction, I'll start by converting the fraction into a decimal.

- To convert 8/9 to a decimal, I'll divide 8 by 9:

8 ÷ 9 = 0.888...≈ 0.89

Now, I can compare all the three numbers as decimals:

- 0.85
- 0.888... (from 8/9)
- 0.92

From looking at the numbers, **_0.85_** appear to be the smallest, then **_0.888...(8/9)_**, and finally **_0.92_ is the largest**.

So the correct order from the least to the greatest is: **0.85, 8/9, 0.92**.
