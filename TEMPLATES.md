## 1. Decimal -> Fraction Conversion

**Steps:**

1. **Definition / Concept**

   - Each digit after the decimal corresponds to a power of 10 in the denominator.

2. **Identification**

   - Count digits after the decimal → denominator = 10^n.

3. **Conversion / Application**

   - Write the number as numerator/denominator.

4. **Simplification / Verification**
   - Divide by GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) if possible.

**Example:**  
0.6239 has 4 decimal places → denominator = 10,000.  
\[
0.6239 = \frac{6239}{10,000}
\]  
Already in simplest form.

## 2. Fraction Simplification

**Steps:**

1. **Definition / Concept**

   - A fraction is simplified when numerator and denominator share no common factors except 1.

2. **Identification**

   - Find GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of numerator and denominator.

3. **Conversion / Application**

   - Divide numerator and denominator by GCD (Greatest Common Divisor).

4. **Simplification / Verification**
   - Check if fraction is fully reduced.

## 3. Solving Linear Equations (Algebra)

**Steps:**

1. **Definition / Concept**

   - A linear equation has the form ax + b = c.
   - Goal: isolate the variable.

2. **Identification**

   - Identify coefficients and constants.

3. **Conversion / Application**

   - Perform inverse operations to isolate variable.

4. **Simplification / Verification**
   - Check solution by substituting back into original equation.

## 4. Geometry Proof (Angle / Triangle Problems)

**Steps:**

1. **Definition / Concept**

   - Recall relevant theorem (e.g., Triangle Sum Theorem: angles in a triangle add up to 180°).

2. **Identification**

   - Identify which sides/angles/figures are relevant.

3. **Conversion / Application**

   - Apply theorem step by step.

4. **Simplification / Verification**
   - Verify answer with diagram or substitution.

## 5. Word Problems (General Template)

**Steps:**

1. **Definition / Concept**

   - Translate the problem into mathematical language.

2. **Identification**

   - Define variables and what is asked.

3. **Conversion / Application**

   - Build equations/expressions from the words.

4. **Simplification / Verification**
   - Solve, then check if answer makes sense in context.
