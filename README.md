# 🧮 re-math

This is my journey of re-learning math from the ground up to expertise, for sharping logic as a Software Engineer and future AI/ML work.

## Intro

I'm re-learning mathematics from the ground up to strengthen my logical thinking, problem-solving abilities, as foundation for software engineering and future AI/ML work.
This repository documents my journey with notes, exercises, problem-solving, solutions, explanations, practice in a math notebook, and progress tracking.

## 📚 Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundations

- [**In progress**] Arithmetic (fractions, decimals, percentages, ratios)
- [**In progress**] Pre-Algebra (integers, order of operations, simple equations)

### Phase 2: Algebra

- [ ] Algebra I (linear equations, graphing, quadratics, functions)
- [ ] Algebra II (complex numbers, polynomials, logarithms)

---

### Phase 3: Geometry & Trigonometry

- Geometry (shapes, theorems, coordinate geometry)
- Trigonometry (identities, laws of sines/cosines)

---

- **notes.md** → definitions, formulas, explanations
- **exercises.md** → problems to solve
- **solutions/** → detailed worked-out solutions

---

## Learning Strategy

1. **Watch → Read → Solve → Reflect**
2. Daily or weekly practice in notebook
3. Commit progress regularly to GitHub
4. Focus on deep understanding, not just speed
5. Revisit old topics periodically to reinforce mastery

## Progress Tracker

| Phase | Topics                   | Status      |
| ----- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| 1     | Arithmetic & Pre-Algebra | In Progress |

---

## Goals

- Daily or weekly commits (progress will be visible here).

- Build a strong math foundation for problem-solving & AI/ML work.

- Share knowledge, insights, and feedback openly - this repo is both my notebook and a resource for others.
