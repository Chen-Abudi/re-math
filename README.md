# üßÆ re-math

This is my journey of re-learning math from the ground up to expertise, for sharping logic as a Software Engineer and future AI/ML work.

## Intro

I'm re-learning mathematics from the ground up to strengthen my logical thinking, problem-solving abilities, as foundation for software engineering and future AI/ML work.
This repository documents my journey with notes, exercises, problem-solving, solutions, explanations, practice in a math notebook, and progress tracking.

---

## Prerequisites & Tools

- Basic computer literacy
- Physical notebook for practice
- Calculator (scientific recommend)
- Internet access for online resources

---

## How to Use This Repository

- **notes.md** ‚Üí definitions, formulas, explanations
- **exercises.md** ‚Üí problems to solve
- **solutions/** ‚Üí detailed worked-out solutions
- Follow the roadmap phases sequentially
- Check progress tracker for current status

---

## üìö Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundations

- [**In progress**] Arithmetic (fractions, decimals, percentages, ratios)
- [**In progress**] Pre-Algebra (integers, order of operations, simple equations)

### Phase 2: Algebra

- [ ] Algebra I (linear equations, graphing, quadratics, functions)
- [ ] Algebra II (complex numbers, polynomials, logarithms)

---

### Phase 3: Geometry & Trigonometry

- Geometry (shapes, theorems, coordinate geometry)
- Trigonometry (identities, laws of sines/cosines)

---

## Learning Strategy

1. **Watch ‚Üí Read ‚Üí Solve ‚Üí Reflect**
2. Daily or weekly practice in notebook
3. Commit progress regularly to GitHub
4. Focus on deep understanding, not just speed
5. Revisit old topics periodically to reinforce mastery

---

## Study Schedule

- **Time Commitment:** 1-2 hours daily
- **Weekly Goals:** Complete at least 2-3 topics per phase
- **Review Schedule:** Weekly review of previous topics

---

## Tools & Software

- **Graphing:** Desmos, GeoGebra
- **Notes:** Physical notebook + digital markdown
- **Practice:** Khan Academy exercises

---

## Progress Tracker

| Phase | Topics                   | Status          |
| ----- | ------------------------ | --------------- |
| 1     | Arithmetic & Pre-Algebra | **In Progress** |

---

## Goals

- Daily or weekly commits (progress will be visible here).

- Build a strong math foundation for problem-solving & AI/ML work.

- Share knowledge, insights, and feedback openly - this repo is both my notebook and a resource for others.
