# ðŸ§® re-math

This is my journey of re-learning math from the ground up to expertise, for sharping logic as a Software Engineer and future AI/ML work.

## Intro

I'm re-learning mathematics from the ground up to strengthen my logical thinking, problem-solving abilities, as foundation for software engineering and future AI/ML work.
This repository documents my journey with notes, exercises, problem-solving, solutions, explanations, practice in a math notebook, and progress tracking.

## ðŸ“š Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundations

- [ ] Arithmetic (fractions, decimals, percentages, ratios)
- [ ] Pre-Algebra (integers, order of operations, simple equations)

---

## Goals

- Daily or weekly commits (progress will be visible here).

- Build a strong math foundation for problem-solving & AI/ML work.

- Share knowledge, insights, and feedback openly - this repo is both my notebook and a resource for others.
